## Customization

You can customize the merchant name mapping and spending categories by editing the following files:

-   `merchant_map.json`: Use this to group different merchant names under a single, standard name. For example, map `"Walmart Store #123"` and `"WALMART.COM"` to `"Walmart"`.
    ```json
    {
      "Walmart Store #123": "Walmart",
      "WALMART.COM": "Walmart"
    }
    ```

-   `category.json`: Define your spending categories and the keywords (standardized merchant names) that belong to them.
    ```json
    {
      "Groceries": ["Walmart", "SUPERSTORE", "SAFEWAY"],
      "Entertainment": ["Netflix", "Spotify"],
      "Restaurants": ["STARBUCKS"]
    }
    ```
